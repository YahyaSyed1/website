                        Data science is the field of computer science I want to go into the most. Analyzing large datasets
                        is something that I find interesting because of all the unique information it can provide. It's also
                        a growing field, so positions as data scientists are always in demand.

                        Software engineering is one of the most prevalent fields for computer science. The majority of companies
                        need some sort of software engineer, whether it's for product development or building a website. My previous
                        internship was as a software engineer, and it was a role that I enjoyed because of the various tasks I worked on,
                        including unit testing and cloud programming.
